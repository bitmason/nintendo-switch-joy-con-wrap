##Nintendo Switch Joy-Con wrap/paint (mockup &amp; templates)

Saw some hi-res views of the Joy-Con floating around today and thought it would be fun to mock up different wraps/paints/colours/textures. GIMP template XCF was too big to upload to GitHub; component layers are here instead.

Camo and Canadian flag examples. Knock yourself out.
