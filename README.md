##Mockup of Nintendo Switch Joy-Con wrap (&amp; GIMP template)

Saw some hi-res views of the Joy-Con floating around today. I thought it would be fun to mock up different wraps/colours/textures. GIMP template XCF was too big to upload to GitHub; component layers are here instead.

A camo example is shown. Have at it.
